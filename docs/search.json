The story doesn’t end with the number of base-pairs or nucleotides, within it there is another large more complexity society where everybody has got some works to support those three billion system.\nThe story of Epigenetics not only tells the action of biological macromolecules, it also learns and modifies itself with the surroundings. In the computer system, the advanced algorithm helps to learn from various kind of data and apply them to another set of the data to generate or validate a hypothesis.\nWith the Big data, human minds need years to read a set of data whereas the computer can read it faster and along with the algorithm it can also understands the pattern of the data to validate the hypothesis. Artificial Intelligent after all can thus reduce the work load for biologists with the proper design of the algorithm.\nWhy do this?\n\nTuberculosis, with the long co-evolutionary history with mankind and more than one million death worldwide per year, is one of the infectious diseases which has only one known vaccine till date. Identification of new bio-signature can show pave to the development of a new vaccine.\nMachine learning is used to develop the biosignature from the epigenetics data.\n\nRelated publication:\nDas, J., Idh, N., Pehrson, I., Paues, J., & Lerm, M.

    "text": "Identification of Differential Methylation patterns of tuberculosis patients, household contacts and healthy participants.\nDNA methylation is one of the epigenetic changes that regulates the function of the genes in human as well as other living organisms. The cytosine base of the DNA molecules sometimes get methylated with one methyl (-CH3) group at its 5′ carbon molecule. In a particular position, the methylation varies due to their different presence in different cells.\nArray-based methylation using Illumina or genome-wide methylation analysis generates a lot of data which requires strong computational approaches to identify the differential methylation patterns between the sample groups. The array-based methylation value is calculated mainly using the 𝛃 value which is a ratio of methylation value over the unmethylation value with a static coefficient. The mathematical equation to calculate the 𝛃 value is:\nwhere M = methylated value; UM = Unmethylated value, c= constant =100; -1 ≤ 𝛃 ≤ 1 With other epigenetic modifiers like Histone modifications, microRNAs, the main role of the DNA methylation is to regulate the gene expression levels and that also reflects to the protein expressions.\nThe cytosine with methyl base and a guanine molecule creates a stretch of similar CpG base-pairs that is known as the CpG islands. The stretch can be short or long to several hundred base-pairs together. These CpG islands dispersed over transcription start sites (TSS), promoters, intergenic regions and also gene body regions.\nWhy do this?\nDNA methylation is variable and also depends on the external environments. Exposure to different environmental conditions changes the pattern of the methylation. In this project, the hypothesis is that there is a different methylation pattern between individuals when they are either exposed or non-exposed to tuberculosis. The difference in the methylation pattern among differently exposed individuals can lead to the identification of the responsible genes or pathways that helps to the fast tuberculosis diagnosis as well as the probable treatment procedures.\nRelated publication:\nPehrson, I., Braian, C., Karlsson, L., Idh, N., Danielsson, E.K., Andersson, B., Paues, J., Das, J. and Lerm, M., 2021.

    "text": "Reduced Representation of Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) data analysis from tuberculosis-exposed samples in different cell types. \nA number of methods are available to identify the genome-wide DNA methylation in human and other organisms. Reduced representation of bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is one of these methods to identify the genome-wide DNA methylation using the MspI enzyme library preparation and whole-genome sequencing.\nBisulfite converted DNA preserves the cytosine bases which are methylated in the genome, but converts the non-methylated cytosine residues to thymine residue and that procedure results to the easy identification of the methylated sites in the genome. The standard procedure follows the library preparation of bisulfite converted DNA from a small input samples (100 ng) and then use the library in the sequencer with the nucleotide molecules to generate the small stretch of sequences saved in the fastq format.\nWhy do this?\nGenome-wide methylation analysis reveals the intergenic regions along with the genic regions and also identifies methylation patterns other than CpG islands. These illustrates huge scope to identify the new features of the causing disease patterns among the individuals.\nRelated publication:\nKarlsson L, Das J, Nilsson M, Tyrén A, Pehrson I, Idh N, Sayyab S, Paues J, Ugarte-Gil C, Méndez-Aranda M, Lerm M.

    "text": "Most of the proteins carry out their functions by participating in protein complexes. Recently, miRNAs are identified as promising post-transcriptional regulators that influence a large proportion of genes in higher eukaryotes. We aim to understand the role of miRNA in the regulation of human proteins that are present in protein complexes. Here, we show that robust regulations of miRNA are absent in human complex forming proteins. Moreover, the numbers of miRNA hits cannot direct the evolutionary fate of complex-forming proteins independently. However, the duplicated complex-forming proteins having a severe effect on organismal fitness are profoundly targeted by miRNA, probably for reducing the chances of dosage imbalance.\nRelated publication:\nDas J, Chakraborty S, Podder S, Ghosh TC.

    "text": "Insights into the miRNA regulations in human disease genes.\nMicroRNAs are a class of short non-coding RNAs derived from either cellular or viral transcripts that act post-transcriptionally to regulate mRNA stability and translation. In recent days, increasing numbers of miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development and progression of a variety of diseases. We, therefore, intend to enumerate miRNA targets in several known disease classes to explore the degree of miRNA regulations on them which is unexplored till date. Here, we noticed that miRNA hits in cancer genes are remarkably higher than other diseases in human. Our observation suggests that UTRs and the transcript length of cancer related genes have a significant contribution in higher susceptibility to miRNA regulation. Moreover, gene duplication, mRNA stability, AREScores and evolutionary rate were likely to have implications for more miRNA targeting on cancer genes. Consequently, the regression analysis has confirmed that the AREScores plays most important role in detecting miRNA targets on disease genes. Interestingly, we observed that epigenetic modifications like CpG methylation and histone modification are less effective than miRNA regulations in controlling the gene expression of cancer genes. The intrinsic properties of cancer genes studied here, for higher miRNA targeting will enhance the knowledge on cancer gene regulation.\nRelated publication:\nDas J, Podder S, Ghosh TC.

    "text": "Explicating the role of old miRNAs in human disease progression\nMost of the microRNAs (miRNAs) are mainly described as conserved in the evolutionary timescales, although some miRNAs are species-specific in nature. The conserved “old” miRNAs and “newly” emerged miRNAs may have played some differential roles in human disease progression. However, modulating the level of expression of human disease genes by new and old miRNAs has not been testified yet. Here, we identified 1,190 new and 97 old miRNAs in humans and showed that these old miRNAs play more influential roles in human disease gene expression levels than the new ones. Additionally, we also performed our analyses on four other mammals to find whether a similar pattern of miRNA regulation is followed there as that showed by old miRNAs in humans. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that miRNAs targeting is dominant over other genomic regulators in controlling human disease gene expression levels. Our study demonstrated that the early evolutionary miRNAs are retained in the organisms to do some specific functions despite of the fact that more number of genes are being targeted by new miRNAs."
